# Kattis

This repository contains some of [my](https://open.kattis.com/users/soelvsten) solutions for various
[Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) problems. These have mainly been done to learn some new
programming language. That is, the focus has been more on exploring and using language features than
to solve complex problems.

## Haskell

The Haskell solutions (folders with `.hs` suffix) are each their own [Haskell
Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org/) projects. To build and run each solution, use the following
Bash commands.

```bash
cd <problem-id>.hs
stack build
stack exec <problem-id>
```
